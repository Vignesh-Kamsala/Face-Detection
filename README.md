# Face Detection Practice

This repository is a practice project for face detection using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe technologies.

## Features

- Face detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe
- Simple scripts for experimentation and learning
- Easy to run and modify for your own practice

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (`opencv-python` package)
- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) (`mediapipe` package)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (`numpy` package)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

### Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vignesh-Kamsala/Face-Detection.git
cd Face-Detection
```

Run the main detection script (replace with your actual script name if different):

```bash
python face_detection.py
```

- The script will open your webcam and start detecting faces in real-time.
- Press `q` to quit the program.

## Notes

- This project is for personal practice and experimentation.
- Feel free to explore and modify the code for your own learning.
